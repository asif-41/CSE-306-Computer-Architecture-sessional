For compiling a source code,
Keep the source file in same directory as "MIPS_Compiler.py" and
run the following command in terminal:

python MIPS_Compiler.py <File_Name>

Then two file will be created. 
1. hex_code.txt
2. interim_code.txt

Then load the hex_code.txt file into instruction memory.

N.B.: When doing simulation, first click the <Reset> button to initiate.
